In order to use this R package, start a shell in this directory, then use
   R CMD INSTALL frechet
which compiles and installs the package. After that, you can use R and library(frechet).

Look at tests.R for the boilerplate tests and benchmark.R for some benchmarks of the algortihm
inside. A dataset is also available, use data(sanfrancisco) after loading the package.

However, this is work in progress and not yet ready for production.
