Range Queries under True Fréchet Distance - Consolidated Outcomes of the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Cup 2017

# Scope
This repository aims to consolidate and bring together the implementations of the three winners of the ACM SIGSPATIAL Cup 2017 
on range queries under Fréchet distance in a directly usable form.

We present a single-file, header-only unified implementation relying on boost::geometry, some examples, as well as an R package 
that we intend to bring to CRAN, soon.

Remark: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. NOTHING WORKS NOW ;-)
